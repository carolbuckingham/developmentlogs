# Data Collection - Survey123 applications

## Creating a basic form with Survey123
1. Log in to the Survey123 website using Fleming College access.
2. From the main page, choose "+ New Survey" and choose one of the options - I will be testing both using a template and creating from scratch.

### Template options:
3. Click get started under Template survey.
4. I chose the "Report trail hazards and maintenance issues" template, since this will also give us a better idea in terms of designing our final project maintenance data collection form.
5. This template has 10 questions to be answered:
- Trail name
- observation date and time (which appears to autofill with the date and time the form is opened)
- mile marker (easily changable to km since we are in Canada)
- map for geolocation (with an option to choose your current location if on the trail!)
- photo of the maintenance/hazard (include up to 3 files)
- type of hazard/maintenance needed (dropdown options)
    - options include: trail washout, trail not well defined, trail flooded, downed tree, poisonous plants, animal observation, structure in need of maintenance, trash, and OTHER
    - if the hazard question is answered with Poisonous plant, a follow up question asks for plant type
    - if the hazard question is answered with animal observation, a follow up question asks for animal type
- a description box (with no character limit)
- choose a level of severity (4 options)
6. We wouldn't need the trail name question so I've removed it, and I've changed the MILE to KILOMETER via the Edit panel along the side: when a question is clicked it is easily editable in the right-hand panel.
7. For our website I will need to go into detail about the options available for each question, I need to set aside some time to write those out and perhaps think about the other question types that could be used. BUT we're not using Esri products so it would be better to more fully explore this in KoBoToolbox.
8. After making all edits, click Save on the lower right portion of the site. Then click Publish to be able to access the form for testing.

### Blank survey options:

## Embedding a Survey123 form into a website
1. In the Collaborate tab, navigate to "Who can submit to this survey?" - in order to be able to embed the survey it MUST be accessible to everyone. Checking that box and then saving will provide access to a link: Embed in website.
2. Click on the link and a side bar pulls up on the right with the embed code created for you! All that's left to do is insert it into your website. You can check different options to change the style of your survey, but doing so means you will need to update your embedded code section after checking or unchecking boxes.
