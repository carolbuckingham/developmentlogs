# KoBo Toolbox applications
## Set up KoBo Toolbox account
1. Navigate to KoBo Toolbox website (https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) and click Sign Up > Create an account. For both my personal use and any use by the Friends of the Dumoine River, it would be classified as "Researchers, Aid Workers & Everyone Else". This type of account gets up to 10,000 submissions and 5GB of data storage per month as well as unlimited projects.
2. Created an account using my personal email (for future use in the Collaborative project, this would need to be registered to an email associated with the Friends organization).
3. Navigate to your email account after completing and click the activation link to complete registration. This will direct to the main page of the account.
4. On the main project page, click NEW > Build from scratch. Insert project name; optionally fill in description, sector and country.
5.
