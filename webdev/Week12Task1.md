# Mapbox API application

## Creating a basic web map for the Dumoine River Tote Road using GeoJSON
1. Repurposed mapboxgeojson.html file created during March 30 Week 11 Task 3 documentation.
2. Removed code pertaining to old file and replaced with example code from https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/geojson-line/.
3. Uploaded shapefile to Mapbox tilesets within Mapbox Studio: https://studio.mapbox.com/tilesets/.
4. Integrated the code to add a layer via tilesets, url is in the form: mapbox://tilesetid.

Still have been unable to get additional layers to display: 
- work on other options for data entry on MapBox website: datasets vs tilesets
- troubleshoot language to ensure that all elements are correct
