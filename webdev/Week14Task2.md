# KoBoToolbox solution section

## Screenshot collection and implementation
1. Several screenshots have already been acquired throughout the processes outlined in Week13Task2.md (https://github.com/carolbuckingham/developmentlogs/blob/main/Week13Task2.md). The following screenshots will be shown on the site to illustrate the process:
  - a collection of screenshots to show the 2 completed forms (we need to future proof the website!)

In the documentation for the form filling and usage, mention that it DOES NOT load on private browsing mode! If users use this they will not be able to access the form. If it makes sense I may also add screenshots of the issues with importing the initial XLSForm to KoBoToolbox from Survey123.

2. I also put together a combo screenshot for the final solution page including both forms in as much of their entirety as I could fit without making a huge image element!
