# KoBo Toolbox applications
## Set up KoBo Toolbox account
1. Navigate to KoBo Toolbox website (https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) and click Sign Up > Create an account. For both my personal use and any use by the Friends of the Dumoine River, it would be classified as "Researchers, Aid Workers & Everyone Else". This type of account gets up to 10,000 submissions and 5GB of data storage per month as well as unlimited projects.
2. Created an account using my personal email (for future use in the Collaborative project, this would need to be registered to an email associated with the Friends organization).
3. Navigate to your email account after completing and click the activation link to complete registration. This will direct to the main page of the account.

## Create a project within KoBo Toolbox
1. On the main project page, click NEW > Build from scratch. Insert project name; optionally fill in description, sector and country.
2. Inserted 1st question with options to fill out a form for a point of interest or a campsite maintenance request - in the options for this question made it required for the survey. In this dialog box are options to make certain questions show up once an certain answer has been selected. This means that we do not need to make multiple tools for the website, but we could if we want to!
3. Added a question to include location data as an optional question.
4. Stopped work to complete other assignments after 60 minutes.

5. During team meeting on April 5th, deployed the form from the main library page upon logging in to test location functionality. Contains option to use current location, pick a point on the map, or insert GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude, elevation, and accuracy).
