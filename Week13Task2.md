# Data Collection - KoBoToolbox applications

## Creating a basic form with KoBoToolbox
1. Log in to the KoBoToolbox website with user credentials.
2. From the main page, choose "NEW" and choose one of the options - I will be testing both creating via importing an XLS and creating from scratch.

### Import from XLSForm option:
3. Choose "Upload an XLSForm" and select the file to upload: my file was titled MaintenanceFromTemplate.xlsx (... typing *from* and *form* for this section of Web Dev and Collab has been very hard, like really).
4. The title comes up with odd formatting so this will need to be changed before deploying. Add an appropriate description, sector and country. Click "CREATE PROJECT".
5. This will bring up the form version page: from here, click the eye icon ("Preview" on hover) to view what the form has displayed as. The formatting for the text in many of the slots has additional formatting that will need to be removed before deploying. Close the preview window.
6. Click the ellipses icon ("More actions" on hover) then "Clone this project" - I changed the title in the window this action brought up, with this form being edited to show the difference between the original import and what had to be changed to have a readable, useable form.
8. In the form version page, click the pencil icon ("Edit in Form Builder" on hover).
9. The first four sections are not necessary as these are only to say that the survey was cxreated in Survey123. In each of the remaining questions, remove the additional HTML for clarity. Once this is completed, click the eye icon to preview the updated form. I'm satisfied with the results, so I closed the preview. Click "SAVE*" (the star means that there are new unsaved changes), and then close the survey once saving is complete.
10. On the form page, deploy the form. JUST KIDDING! There's an error!!

### Blank survey option: (after completing steps ?? from above)
