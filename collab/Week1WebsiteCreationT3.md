# Website Creation - GitHub
Once you have a repository begun on GitHub, you can choose to edit your files directly through GitHub's website or you can use an external coding software. I will be using Visual Studio Code to complete my updates to the repository.

## Creation and organization of supplemental files
1. within visual studio code..

## HTML file skeleton
***I started with the head element of the pages since this will be the simplest to complete and should be done first to clarify the subject matter of each webpage.***
1. add in html, head, and body elements
