## Restructuring the current pages
After discussion with our client, we will be changing the current layout to better reflect the organization's needs and vision. Each of the partner pages will be collapsed down into one greater partner page with a logo, short description, and link to that group's webpage (if available), as well as any additional information provided by the Friends and their partners.

1. The pages CPAWS-OV, wlfn, and ZEC can be deleted or repurposed at this stage. I moved the relevant comments from all pages into the original CPAWS-OV.html file, renamed it partners.html and moved it into the information folder.


## Repository format and design**


***The client has requested pages for the following: who are the Friends, logistics, history of the trail, information about the ZEC Dumoine, information about CPAWS Ottawa Valley, and information about Wolf Lake First Nation. We are including a separate landing page and web map site.***
