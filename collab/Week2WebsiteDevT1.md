# Website Development - GitHub

## Restructuring the current pages
After discussion with our client, we will be changing the current layout to better reflect the organization's needs and vision. Each of the partner pages will be collapsed down into one greater partner page with a logo, short description, and link to that group's webpage (if available), as well as any additional information provided by the Friends and their partners.

1. The pages CPAWS-OV, wlfn, and ZEC can be deleted or repurposed at this stage. I moved the relevant comments from all pages into the original CPAWS-OV.html file, renamed it fodr-partners.html and moved it into the information folder.
2. The partners folder and the remaining 2 html files were deleted. 
3. All changes pushed to GitHub via VSC.

## Researching website design and visualization
Our client has not provided us with a clear vision of what they want in terms of the layout of the site apart from the pages they absolutely want and a request to have a navbar across the top of each page. Below I have listed some websites to look into from my own research that I think are good trail and outdoor recreation websites, as well as other general reference websites.

- Ontario Parks https://www.ontarioparks.com/en
- Trans Canada Trail https://tctrail.ca/
- Great Lakes Waterfront Trail https://waterfronttrail.org/
- Cataraqui Trail https://cataraquitrail.ca/ https://cataraquitrail.ca/trail-info/links/ - these ones are good and also have some areas to be improved upon
- Lewis and Clark trail (and National Park Service) https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/national-historic-trails.htm
- Uxbridge Historic Trail https://discoveruxbridge.ca/trails/historic-trail/
- Parks Canada National Historic Sites https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs?utm_campaign=pc-pc-visitation-conservation-21-22&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=ggl&utm_content=ad-text-en&utm_term=historic%20sites%20canada&adv=2223-211350&id_campaign=16649278554&id_source=134381463309&id_content=589457079059&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjfni6vD69wIVGxXUAR3DTgUxEAAYAiAAEgL1h_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds


***The sites listed above are to be evaluated and any elements that are liked will be added into the list of potential design elements for our growing website.***
