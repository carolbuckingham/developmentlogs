# Account Organization

## A simpler solution
In order to create some of the products for our client, we require the use and maintenance of several accounts attached to an email address. Friends of Dumoine River does have their own email account that has been used to set up and maintain their Facebook page, but using this could cause some logistical issues because we would either need to walk Wally through how to create these accounts or be provided with the password to the email and maintain access over the course of development. 
To simplify the back-end set up of accounts for this project, our group decided to create a new email address for the organization. We did collaborate with our client and some of the volunteers involved with the organization, and we ended up deciding to create a Gmail account after our first meeting with Eric: fodr.arm@gmail.com
Our team has since created accounts using this email for Mapbox, KoBoToolbox, and GitHub.

*All account usernames and passwords are being added to a Word document, stored in our shared Collab folder within Fleming College's OneDrive, which will be passed off to the client along with the previously promised deliverables.*
