# Website Creation - GitHub

## Creating a repository
1. Log in to GitHub - currently using my personal account.
2. From the main page, by Recent Repositories choose "New".
3. Choose an appropriate name ("dumoine-river" for the English site, with a plan to use "rivere-dumoine" for the French site). I then provided a brief description for the repository. I also chose to include a README file, which can be deleted later if deemed unnecessary. Keep the repository as Public.
4. At the bottom of the page, click "Create repository".
5. Within the "Settings" tab, go to "Pages". Under source, select the main branch. Click "Save" - this will publish the files online as they are created and updated.
6. Go to the "Collaborators" section and add any collaborators you wish. I added Kira and Allison as we will be working on this project together.

## Repository format and design
7. I created folders for any images, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON for the site within the main branch. To do this you type in the folder name and a forward slash ('/') and then a file name to secure the folder connection. I made .md files to delete later if not needed.
8. Within the main folder I also created a file for the landing page: home.html
9. I then created a folder for the information pages on the Friends of the Dumoine and made 3 pages within it: fodr-about.html, fodr-logistics.html, trail-history.html
10. I then created a folder for the partner pages of the Friends of the Dumoine and made 2 pages within it: wlfn.html, zec.html
11. I then created a folder for the mapping page and created an html file within it to house the Mapbox map: webmap.html

***The client has requested pages for the following: who are the Friends, logistics, history of the trail, information about the ZEC, and information about Wolf Lake First Nation. We are including a separate landing page and web map site.***
