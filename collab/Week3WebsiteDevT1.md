# Website Development - GitHub

## Restructuring the current pages.. again
After discussion with our client, we will be changing the current layout to better reflect the organization's needs and vision. Our client would like to keep the trail as a separate initiative that they and several other partners have been collaborating on, and to have the focus of this page be on the trail versus their organization. This is a relief since it will make the website fit better within the academic scope of our project.

1. All pages with 'fodr' in the name have been changed to remove the association to the *Friends* and refocus on the trail itself.
2. The about us page will be repurposed since this information will be condensed into the home and partners pages. This file was moved to the tote-road folder and renamed trail-conditions.html to house the content for active trail conditions.
3. Created a file to house the content for trail hazards and best practices: trail-information.html
4. Removed all 'fodr' and 'dr' file prefixes.
5. Changed the title of the home page and index page to reflect the true vision for the website.
6. All changes pushed to GitHub via VSC.
